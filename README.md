E-Commerce Website



I have created a simple e-commerce website with a primary focus on login, sign-up, and password recovery tasks. For the frontend, I utilized HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap5. On the backend, I employed Java, SQL, JSP, and for database connectivity, I integrated the Hibernate framework.

The main page of the website is Home.jsp. Users are required to log in before accessing other functionalities. If they are new users, they can create a new account and then log in.

Additionally, a logout feature is available, which redirects users to the LoginPage. In the event that a user forgets their password, they are prompted to answer security questions during account creation, which are then used for password reset purposes.

The IDE used is Eclipse for importing the project you need to import Maven Existing project.
------->  File->Import->Maven->Existing Maven Project->Browse Directory->Finish.

Before run the project you also need to create database and its tables the existing data from the tables beacuse if images name are get wrong spelled then it will not display it in the UI.
Best of Luck !!
